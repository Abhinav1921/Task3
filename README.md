# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this task was to practice SQL querying techniques for extracting and analyzing data from a structured database. The goal was to apply SQL operations such as SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregate functions, and query optimization.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Database**: MySQL
- **Query Operations**: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOINs, Subqueries, Aggregate Functions, Views
- **Optimization**: Indexing for query performance improvement

## Dataset
For this task, I used the **Ecommerce_SQL_Database** (or any other dataset of your choice). This database contains tables related to ecommerce transactions and customer data, which were used for extracting and analyzing relevant information.

## Task Breakdown
1. **Basic SQL Queries**:
   - Used the `SELECT` statement to fetch data from one or more tables.
   - Applied the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on specific conditions.

2. **Data Sorting**:
   - Implemented `ORDER BY` to sort data in ascending or descending order.

3. **Aggregation and Grouping**:
   - Utilized `GROUP BY` to group records and performed aggregate functions like `SUM` and `AVG` to analyze the data.
   
4. **Join Operations**:
   - Applied various types of `JOINs`:
     - **INNER JOIN**: Combined records from multiple tables where there is a match.
     - **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieved all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
     - **RIGHT JOIN**: Retrieved all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.

5. **Subqueries**:
   - Wrote subqueries to retrieve data based on the results of another query.

6. **Views**:
   - Created views to simplify complex queries and improve readability.

7. **Query Optimization**:
   - Implemented indexing to optimize queries, especially for frequently queried columns.

## Deliverables
- **SQL File**: This file contains all SQL queries written for data extraction and analysis. It can be found in the repository under `Task3.sql`.
- **Screenshots of Outputs**: Screenshots showing the output of the SQL queries. These are included in the `screenshots` folder for visual verification.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Writing efficient SQL queries for data extraction.
- Aggregating data using functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT`.
- Performing JOIN operations between multiple tables.
- Using subqueries to filter and refine results.
- Optimizing queries using indexes for better performance.
- Creating views to encapsulate complex queries.

## Files in this Repository
- **Task3.sql**: SQL file containing all the queries used for data analysis.
- **screenshots/**: Folder containing screenshots of query results for verification.

## Conclusion
By completing this task, I gained practical experience in SQL data manipulation, which includes performing complex queries, aggregating data, optimizing queries, and utilizing JOINs and subqueries to analyze relational databases effectively.
